# Christopher Camacho - Web Dev Portfolio Project

Welcome! My name is Christopher Camacho, and this is the repository section for my final project within Foundations.

I will be walking you through my webpage and what you can find from top to bottom.

## Important Notes

- All of the formatting was made with some sort of CSS Flexbox code.
- I tried to use margins to the best of my ability to line everything together. I would love to improve my skills within this aspect in the future, especially if there's something you deem to be worthy of improvement in that aspect.
- With exceptions that I will name, everything on the webpage is in Jost font.

## 1. Top Row - Heading Name & Nav Bar

This is the first row on the webpage. This includes a large edition of my name in Kanit font, as well as a navigation bar separated by section within the page itself. Each hyperlink takes you to a different section that aligns with the hyperlink's label.

## 2. Second Layer - Profile Picture & Short Opening Description

This is where a profile picture of myself as well as a short description about me has been placed. The image has a light gray surrounding background color/padding. It also links to my LinkedIn within the last sentence.

## 3. Full About Me Section

This is where I have placed a comprehensive about me in detail. It links to my resume at the bottom, as well as has a preview of my resume below. 

## 4. Projects Section & CSS Flexbox Grid

This is where I have laid out 3 projects (or "projects") that I've created to show off. The last project "Personal Blog" is unfortunately a placeholder, but I do want to make one in the future! 

This has been laid out in CSS Flexbox in a grid style with section and div tags utilized. 

## 5. Contact Form

Finally, this is where a non-functional form for submission is placed. It contacts a field for the person's name, email, and short additional message that they would like to add. 

## Please Enjoy!
